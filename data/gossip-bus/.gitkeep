# Gossip Bus — Pattern Exchange Log
# 
# This directory stores patterns exchanged between claws during the 14-day MVP test.
# Each file is a JSON message containing patterns from one claw on a specific timestamp.
#
# Format: {clawId}-{timestamp}.json
# Example: jon-1708858347.json
#
# Files are created automatically during daily sync (midnight UTC).
# All patterns are scanned by ClawMoat before storage.
# Git tracks the complete audit trail.
